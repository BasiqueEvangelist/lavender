```json
{
  "title": "A Category",
  "icon": "minecraft:dirt"
}
```

Just like __entries__, categories fully support **markdown formatting**. Be careful when writing their descriptions
however, as you only get a single page to work with.

1. an element
2. another one
    3. and a nested one
        4. deeper
7. and back to base
