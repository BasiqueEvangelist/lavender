Seeing as {light_purple}Gilded Blackstone{} has some peculiar magical properties, it seems perfectly reasonable to
construct a pedestal out of it. These have been proved to excel at presenting items and providing their essence, enabling
the performing of {gold}rituals{}. Prior to this, however, the pedestals {gold}need to be linked{} to the respective
ritual's core.

<recipe;conjuring:crafting/blackstone_pedestal>

This is accomplished by {gold}shift-right-clicking{} first a pedestal and then the corresponding ritual core, all while
wielding a [Conjuring Scepter](^lavender-flower:profound_page#3) of any kind
