Getting hold of some {gold}Ametyhst{} is of essential necessity before you can start constructing your {light_purple}Assembly 
Augment{} and associated {light_purple}Arcane Treetaps{}.

<recipe;affinity:crafting/arcane_treetap>

;;;;;

<recipe;affinity:crafting/assembly_augment>

Once you have obtained {gold}at least one{} treetap alongside your augment, you can place the augment atop a 
{light_purple}Crafting Table{} like shown on the next page...


;;;;;

<structure;affinity:augmented_crafting_table>

... and then continue by installing all treetaps onto {gold}naturally grown trees{} in close vicinity of the augmented
crafting table.
