Seeing as {light_purple}Gilded Blackstone{} has some peculiar magical properties, it seems perfectly reasonable to 
construct a pedestal out of it. These have been proved to excel at presenting items and providing their essence, enabling
the performing of {gold}rituals{}. Prior to this, however, the pedestals {gold}need to be linked{} to the respective
ritual's core.

;;;;;

<recipe;conjuring:crafting/blackstone_pedestal>

This is accomplished by {gold}shift-right-clicking{} first a pedestal and then the corresponding ritual core, all while
wielding a [Conjuring Scepter](linknite) of any kind

and let's also have some **markdown** here

and a [link](https://wispforest.io)

now, after we're {gold}done{} there let's have a list

;;;;;

- list item 1
- and another one
    - nesting moment
- less nesting

ayo, were on page 2!

While being the most basic substance involved in summoning, {light_purple}Conjuration Essence{} is still of utmost importance. It embodies 
the most basic properties all souls share and is therefore involved in the creation of many more capable materials.


One can obtain some essence of their own from {gold}breaking ordinary spawners{} as well as {gold}plundering chests{}.

;;;;;

For when a less concentrated material is required, simply {gold}sneak-right-clicking{} some essence on any stone-like surface 
smashes it into 4 pieces of {light_purple}Lesser Conjuration Essence{}

*~a fine predicament*
