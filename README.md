Lavender is tool allowing modders, modpack makers and everybody else to create player guides and other in-game documentation in the form of easy-to-read, intuitive guide books.

Everything is written using easy to learn, familiar and, most importantly, readable markdown with a bunch of [special syntax](https://docs.wispforest.io/lavender/markdown-syntax/) to seamlessly integrate with the game. This is augmented with support for powerful macros and the entirety of the [owo-ui framework](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/ui/) at your fingertips

Further, for the first time in any guidebook mod (we believe), all books can be viewed in-game when placed in the offhand - extremely useful for referencing an entry while carrying out its instructions

## Features
- Fully data-driven book authoring with near-instant hot reloading
- Optional grouping of entries into categories for easy discovery
- Deep linking between entries and categories
- Structure/Multiblock visualization and building assistance
- Gradual content unlocking, backed by the game's advancement system
- Built-in support for visualizing all vanilla recipe types and an easy framework for implementing custom ones
- Localization support
- Individual bookmarks for each save
- Support for extending another mod's books, extremely useful for seamlessly integrating your addon's documentation
